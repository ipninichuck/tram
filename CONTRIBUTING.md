# Contribute
You can help contribute to TRAM! We hope the community can help us improve our NLP models, by contributing to ATT&CK (https://attack.mitre.org/resources/contribute/). Additionally, we are looking for contributions to find techniques in reporting that currently do not have enough data to have NLP models built (ie. techniques with less than 10 Procedure Examples).
